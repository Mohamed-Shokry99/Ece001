Basics
Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that 
perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving 
its goals.[3] A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as "a system's ability to correctly 
interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific 
goals and tasks through flexible adaptation."[77]

A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.[3]
 An AI's intended utility function (or goal) can be simple ("1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 
 0 otherwise") or complex ("Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in 
 the past"). Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for 
 "reinforcement learning", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior 
 or punishing others.[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a 
 "fitness function" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to 
 how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.[78] Some AI systems, 
 such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, 
 except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.[79] Such systems can still 
 be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose "goal" is to accomplish its 
 narrow classification task.[80]

AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions 
that a mechanical computer can execute.[b] A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, 
simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) 
recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:[81]

1-If someone has a "threat" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,
2-if a move "forks" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,
3-take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,
4-if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,
5-take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,
6-take any empty square.

Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new 
heuristics (strategies, or "rules of thumb", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves 
write other algorithms. Some of the "learners" described below, including Bayesian networks, 
decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) 
learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would 
best describe the world.[citation needed] These learners could therefore derive all possible 
knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, 
it is seldom possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of "combinatorial 
explosion", where the time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research 
involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of possibilities 
unlikely to be beneficial.[82][83] For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest 
driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path 
through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm 
like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be 
ponderously considered.[84]

The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): 
"If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have influenza". 
A second, more general, approach is Bayesian inference: "If the current patient has a fever, 
adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way". 
The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers 
such as SVM and nearest-neighbor: "After examining the records of known past patients whose 
temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those 
patients turned out to have influenza". 
A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's 
machinery works: the artificial neural network approach uses artificial "neurons" that can learn 
by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between 
its internal neurons to "reinforce" connections that seemed to be useful. 
These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, 
neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. 
Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and 
non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.[85][86]

Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well 
in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. 
These inferences can be obvious, such as "since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, 
it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well". 
They can be nuanced, such as "X% of families have geographically separate species with color 
variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist". 
Learners also work on the basis of "Occam's razor": The simplest theory that explains the data is 
the likeliest. 
Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers 
simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven 
substantially better.


The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise.
Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known 
as overfitting. 
Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it 
fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[87]
 Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson".
  A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black 
  cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[88] 
  A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often don't primarily 
  make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn 
  relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images 
  of certain types of real objects. 
  Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in "adversarial" images that the system 
  misclassifies.[c][89][90]


A self-driving car system may use a neural network to determine which parts of the picture seem to 
match previous training images of pedestrians, and then model those areas as slow-moving but 
somewhat unpredictable rectangular prisms that must be avoided.
Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human "commonsense reasoning"; 
most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about "na√Øve physics" such as space, 
time, and physical interactions. 
This enables even young children to easily make inferences like "If I roll this pen off a table, 
it will fall on the floor". 
Humans also have a powerful mechanism of "folk psychology" that helps them to interpret 
natural-language sentences such as "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because 
they advocated violence" (A generic AI has difficulty discerning whether the ones alleged to be 
advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators[91][92][93]). 
This lack of "common knowledge" means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, 
in ways that can seem incomprehensible. 
For example, existing self-driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of 
pedestrians in the exact way that humans do, and instead must use non-human modes of reasoning to 
avoid accidents.[94][95][96]
