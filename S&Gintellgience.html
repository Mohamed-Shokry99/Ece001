Social intelligence
Main article: Affective computing

Kismet, a robot with rudimentary social skills[146]
Moravec's paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence.
[147][148] Distributed multi-agent coordination of autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem.[149]
Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize, 
interpret, process, or simulate human affects.
Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, 
more recently, multimodal affect analysis (see multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI 
classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.

In the long run, social skills and an understanding of human emotion and game theory would be 
valuable to a social agent. 
The ability to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states 
would allow an agent to make better decisions. 
Some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional
dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. 
Similarly, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter 
humorously; this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing 
computer agents actually are.

General intelligence
Main articles: Artificial general intelligence and AI-complete
Historically, projects such as the Cyc knowledge base (1984–) and the massive Japanese Fifth 
Generation Computer Systems initiative (1982–1992) attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition. 
These early projects failed to escape the limitations of non-quantitative symbolic logic models and,
in retrospect, greatly underestimated the difficulty of cross-domain AI. 
Nowadays, most current AI researchers work instead on tractable "narrow AI" applications 
(such as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation). 
Many researchers predict that such "narrow AI" work in different individual domains will 
eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence (AGI), 
combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding 
human ability in most or all these areas. 
Many advances have general, cross-domain significance. 
One high-profile example is that DeepMind in the 2010s developed a 
"generalized artificial intelligence" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own, 
and later developed a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential learning.
Besides transfer learning,[161] hypothetical AGI breakthroughs could include the development of 
reflective architectures that can engage in decision-theoretic metareasoning, and figuring out 
how to "slurp up" a comprehensive knowledge base from the entire unstructured Web.
Some argue that some kind of (currently-undiscovered) conceptually straightforward, but 
mathematically difficult, "Master Algorithm" could lead to AGI. 
Finally, a few "emergent" approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely, 
and believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain or simulated child development 
may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.

Many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to 
solve the problems as well as people do. 
For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like machine translation, require that a 
machine read and write in both languages (NLP), follow the author's argument (reason), know what 
is being talked about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent 
(social intelligence). 
A problem like machine translation is considered "AI-complete", because all of these problems need 
to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.
